        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <div class="experience-item">
          <p class="job-description">
            One of the biggest challenges that web developers face when it comes to repetitive coding tasks and finding efficient solutions to common problems. They often need to write custom code for tasks such as DOM manipulation, for validation, string manipulations, and more. Additionally, managing dependencies and ensuring code reusability can be time-consuming and complex.
            The challenge was to create an application showing my knowledge to write code, trouble shoot when necessary, and create a fully functioning interactive application. One of the challenges that I faced along the way was learning an entirely new language for this project: JavaScript. The web application that I was building needed to provide users with an understanding of my knowledge of this language.

        <h2>Solutions</h2>
        <div class="experience-item">
          <p class="job-description">
            To prove that I knew this language, there were a few things that I included in this project to demonstrate my knowledge. The key features and benefits of the Simple-JS App include:<br>
                1.	Simple design: The design of this application has a very simple approach allowing users to navigate with ease and find the information that they are looking for. <br>
                2.	Comprehensive Functionality: The Simple-JS provides a wide range of functions and utilities that cover various aspects of web development, including DOM manipulation, form validation, AJAX requests, string manipulation, and more. This comprehensive functionality eliminates the need for developers to write repetitive code, thus saving time and effort.<br>
                3.	Clear Documentation and Examples: The app is accompanied by comprehensive documentation that provides clear explanations of each function, along with usage examples and code snippets. This documentation enables developers to quickly understand the features and effectively integrate them into their projects.<br>
