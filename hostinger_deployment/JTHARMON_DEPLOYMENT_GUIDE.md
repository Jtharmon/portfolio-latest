2. **Create Database:**
   - Click **"Create new database"**
   - Database name: `jtharmon_blog` (or any name you prefer)
   - Click **Create**

3. **Create Database User:**
   - Username: `jtharmon_admin` (or any name)
   - Password: Create a secure password
   - **WRITE THESE DOWN:**
     - Database name: `jtharmon_blog`
     - Username: `jtharmon_admin`  
     - Password: `your_secure_password`

4. **Import Database Schema:**
   - Click **"Enter phpMyAdmin"** 
   - Select your database (`jtharmon_blog`)
   - Click **Import** tab
   - Choose file: Upload `database.sql` from the deployment package
   - Click **Go**
   - ✅ You should see: "Import has been successfully finished"

### **STEP 2: Configure Database Connection (2 minutes)**

1. **Edit `api/config.php` file** (before uploading):
   
   Change these 4 lines:
   ```php
   define('DB_NAME', 'jtharmon_blog');        // Your database name
   define('DB_USER', 'jtharmon_admin');       // Your database username  
   define('DB_PASS', 'your_secure_password'); // Your database password
   define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');            // Keep as 'localhost'
   ```

### **STEP 3: Upload Files to Hostinger (5 minutes)**

**Go to hPanel → File Manager → public_html folder**

Upload these files **in this exact structure:**

```
public_html/
├── index.html              ← Upload from deployment package root
├── static/                 ← Upload entire folder from deployment package
├── .htaccess              ← Upload from deployment package root
├── api/                   ← Upload entire folder
│   ├── config.php         ← (with your database credentials updated)
│   ├── posts.php
│   ├── projects.php
│   ├── verify-secret.php
│   ├── upload.php
│   ├── categories.php
│   ├── tags.php

│   └── .htaccess
├── uploads/               ← CREATE this empty folder
└── (other files...)       ← Upload remaining files from deployment package
```

**IMPORTANT:** Create `uploads/` folder manually in File Manager and set permissions to 755
